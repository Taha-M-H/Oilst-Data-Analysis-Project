Project Overview:
This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of the Olist Brazilian E-Commerce dataset, consisting of 100k+ orders from 2016 to 2018. Developed in collaboration with nourhanelboraey and RADWa-2024, the goal was to transform raw transactional data into a structured analytical model to uncover growth drivers and operational bottlenecks.

Data Architecture & Cleaning
We transformed the original relational database into a Star Schema to optimize query performance and reporting.
Fact Table: FactOrders (Delivery performance, order status).
Dimension Tables: DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimSeller, DimDate, DimCategory, and DimOrderPayments.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Revenue: ~16M BRL (Steady growth from 2016 to 2018).
Logistics: Average delivery time of 12.5 days, with a 93.4% on-time delivery rate.
Customer Satisfaction: Average review score of 4.09/5.
Geographic Focus: 50% of sales are driven by São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte.
